## 🤔 Is a Roadmap Necessary? Decision Factors

### ✅ **Reasons Why Roadmap is Needed**

#### **1. Community Expectation Management**
- **Multiple Issues**: Increasing feature requests from users
- **Growing PRs**: High external developer contribution motivation
- **Direction Clarity**: Need criteria for what to accept and what to decline

#### **2. Project Sustainability**
- **Scope Creep Prevention**: Stopping uncontrolled feature additions
- **Development Resource Allocation**: KrishKrosh's time management
- **Technical Debt Avoidance**: Preventing quality degradation from unplanned expansion

#### **3. Educational & Research Value Enhancement**
- **Academic Usage Promotion**: Potential for research institution adoption
- **Educational Material Development**: Direction for curriculum integration
- **Open Science**: Setting research agenda for measurement accuracy improvement

### ❌ **Reasons Why Roadmap is Unnecessary**

#### **1. Experimental Project Nature**
- **"Complete" Status**: v1.0.0 already has "All the features!"
- **Proof of Concept**: Main purpose is idea realization
- **No Commercial Intent**: Business roadmap inappropriate

#### **2. Developer's Stance**
- **Side Project**: Not main focus positioning
- **Multiple Projects**: Priority balance with Hyperlocal, etc.
- **Freedom Priority**: Flexibility over rigid planning

## 🎯 Recommendation: "Lightweight Roadmap"

### **Proposal: Simple Management via GitHub Project Board**

#### **📋 Organize into 3 Categories**

1. **🔧 Maintenance**
   - Bug fixes
   - macOS new version support
   - Dependency library updates

2. **🎓 Educational (Educational Value Enhancement)**
   - Measurement accuracy improvement
   - Educational features (data export, etc.)
   - Multi-language support (expanding educational use)

3. **🧪 Experimental**
   - New sensor utilization
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Cool community ideas

#### **⏱️ Timeline**: "Someday" level
- **Short-term (3 months)**: Maintenance focus
- **Medium-term (6 months-1 year)**: Educational value enhancement
- **Long-term (TBD)**: Experimental - inspiration dependent
