                    <h3>1. Touch & Place</h3>
                    <p>Lightly place your finger on the trackpad, then gently place a small object on it. This activates the Force Touch sensors.</p>

                    <h3>2. Measure</h3>
                    <p>Our app reads the raw pressure data from the sensors and instantly converts it into grams. (Turns out, the data is already in grams!)</p>
